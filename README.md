# About Facebook-Zero-Hosts-Block_git_kowith337

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dead-hosts/Facebook-Zero-Hosts-Block_git_kowith337.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dead-hosts/Facebook-Zero-Hosts-Block_git_kowith337)

> This aim to block non-formal hosts that serve all Facebook contents and resources from alternative "Free Basics" servers that it happen when you're using on mobile data over the carrier that collaborate with Facebook to have that service!
> 
> Currently, all of big 3 mobile carriers in my country are give up to Facebook and let it invade and interrupt the privacy, functionality and usability of their service.
> 
> I'm against to it's shady services because it's show various of annoyance that likely Facebook trying to force me and all of other users to use that, include nasty traffic redirect, showing balloon party cover, inject purple bar above of page or in-app screen or even prevent any videos to play on mobile data, although many users in my country are ok to use the unlimited data plan but limited the connectivity speed.
> 
> In my opinion, I will keep block those connections, no matter about breaking the functionality and usability for using Facebook on mobile data plan due to privacy concern that Facebook itself use uploaded mobile phone numbers for selling to advertisers for direct (re-)targeting ads* until they abandone that services and return all connections to the original favor, no redirects, no non-HTTPS, no nagging or forcing to use that service, just let it should be normal like I and/or we accessing Facebook at home or via Proxy/VPN!
> 
> Note: All rules below will be use as test unit for [@funilrys](https://github.com/funilrys)'s "Dead Hosts" tools (aka. PyFunceble), however, some hosts entry are duplicated based from hosts name that found by myself and more entry from [Credits](https://github.com/kowith337/PersonalFilterListCollection/blob/master/hosts/test/hosts_facebook0.txt#L9) source, Currently I'm still don't know how many "Free Basics" servers are really existed?
> 
> (*): Facebook should be thanks to old technologies (but we still using them nowadays) called "(x-)WAP", "MSISDN", etc. that possible to extract or resolve user's mobile number who use cellular data without hinting the users to manually fill their own numbers and submit to Facebook by themseleves, now some shady company in my country use the same tech above to randomly add bulk mobile phone numbers to subscribe nasty, wasteful and also unwanted content supscriptions without any confirmations from user's side.

# About Dead-hosts

[Dead-Hosts](https://github.com/dead-hosts) is the replacement of the original idea behind [funilrys/dead-hosts](https://github.com/funilrys/dead-hosts).
Indeed, the idea was to test - with the help of PyFunceble and Travis CI - hosts file, list of domains or even bocklist to have a list of only active domains or IP.

Today, we provide our infrastructure for anybody who want it. [Just ask](https://github.com/dead-hosts/dev-center/issues/new?template=inclusion-request.md)!

# About PyFunceble

PyFunceble is the tool that our infrastructure use to get the status (ACTIVE, INVALID, INACTIVE) of a given domain or IPv4.
